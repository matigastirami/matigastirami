### Hi there üëã

# üöÄ About Me

üë®‚ÄçüíªI'm Mat√≠as Ramirez, a Full-Stack Software Developer from Argentina, currently studying Computers Engineering in Buenos Aires Province (More especifically at [UNLaM](https://www.unlam.edu.ar/)). Nowadays working for a US company. 

‚öôÔ∏è I love technology and that's why I'm not only a Developer, but also enjoy working with some hardware stuff as 3D printers and Arduino/Raspberry Pi. Apart from that, I'm a enthusiastic of the videogames desing so I decided to start learning 3D techniques last year (Modeling, Sculpting, Texturing and Animation), I consider I'm still a beginner but try to keep on learning almost everyday I dream on working on the game development industry some day üéÆ. Though I mentioned a lot I'm a developer, it was not always the case. I started working in 2016 as a manual software tester and from there, it was a one way ticket to my current position. Learnt a lot of automation testing also and applied it to some projects I worked along my career, and the decided to switch to a programming position.

‚å®Ô∏è Regarding the technologies I use or know, during my work as a Full-Stack, I've used React.JS, Node.JS, Express, NestJS and also a bit of Vue.JS in my current job. 

üöó I love driving and going on vacation using the car to travel in Argentina, my last vacation was 1000km driving with my girlfriend and it was a great experience. I also went to a Ski center in Mendoza Province called "Las Le√±as". Mendoza is known as the "Land of wine", so I don't need to mention I visited some wineries to taste some of the best wines Argentina produces and exports to all over the world üòÖ.

üìñ Also, I love taking some time to read some books; being economics and finances my favorite categories.

# üéì Next Steps in my career
ü™ú As a believer of "Keep on learning" philosophy, I'm planning to continue doing 3D courses to reinforce that knowledge and try to create a little indie game. Also, I deeply desire to start learning about Blockchain development, but I prefer going step by step as free personal time is not infinite, and the university demands lot of my time. Finally, I would like to get into AI development world.
