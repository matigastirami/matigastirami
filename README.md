### Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me

👨‍💻I'm Matías Ramirez, a Full-Stack Software Developer from Argentina, currently studying Computers Engineering in Buenos Aires Province (More especifically at [UNLaM](https://www.unlam.edu.ar/)). Nowadays working for a US company. 

⚙️ I love technology and that's why I'm not only a Developer, but also enjoy working with some hardware stuff as 3D printers and Arduino/Raspberry Pi. Apart from that, I'm a enthusiastic of the videogames desing so I decided to start learning 3D techniques last year (Modeling, Sculpting, Texturing and Animation), I consider I'm still a beginner but try to keep on learning almost everyday I dream on working on the game development industry some day 🎮.  

⌨️ Regarding the technologies I use or know, during my work as a Full-Stack, I've used React.JS, Node.JS, Express, NestJS and also a bit of Vue.JS in my current job. 

🚗 I love driving and going on vacation using the car to travel in Argentina, my last vacation was 1000km driving with my girlfriend and it was a great experience. I also went to a Ski center in Mendoza Province called "Las Leñas". Mendoza is known as the "Land of wine", so I don't need to mention I visited some wineries to taste some of the best wines Argentina produces and exports to all over the world 😅.

📖 Also, I love taking some time to read some books; being economics and finances my favorite categories.
