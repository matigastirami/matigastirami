### Hi there üëã

# üöÄ About Me

üë®‚ÄçüíªI'm Mat√≠as Ramirez, a Fullstack Software Developer from Argentina, nowadays working for a US company. 

I'm a product-minded developer who strives to make any product to success, and due to that, I'm kind of language agnostic, I can adapt even to languages I've never worked on in record time. I also define myself as a can-do person who does not say no to any responsibility when it comes to tasks that moves me out from my comfort-zone.

I'm working on a side-project that aims to help language institutions to evaluate students faster and smarter through the use of AI. 

My preference is working at product startups, and though I don't have any problem with any stage, I'd like series pre-seed, seed, and A the most as they have environments in which I can get my hands dirty and fully understand the domain and users' preferences.
